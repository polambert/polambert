Hi, I'm Parker Lambert, a software engineer in high school.
I'm going to the University of South Carolina next year as a CS major.
I'm currently interested in Rust, because it seems to be the low-level language of the future.
If you want to get in touch with me, you can find my contact information at https://polambert.com.
